# ORVnetworkVisuals
This is the companion to the work that I did for ORV Relationship Analysis as I made the changes in changed_extracting_relations, you can see the whole thing here https://github.com/Jeybird248/ORV-Relationship-Analysis

Character relationships are often the most interesting element in a story. Without understanding the relationships, it is very difficult to follow up the context. Meanwhile the relationship is dynamic, continue to change.
Using web scraping I got all of the character names from the Wikipedia page, https://omniscient-readers-viewpoint.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Characters. Then, I created a network graphic among the characters. The challenge was that each character kept interacting with each other causing the characters to wiggle perpetually. My contribution was web scraping and making the network graphics. This technique can be applied to analyze the relationships of a community in real life.
